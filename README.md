# The Surface Defect Inspection (SDI) Dataset

This is the datasets of the paper "Defect Transfer GAN: Diverse Defect Synthesis for Data Augmentation" published on BMVC2022.
It consists of three types of product surface and each image is labeled with its corresponding defect type.
The detailed introdution of the dataset can be found in [DT_GAN_BMVC_SDI_dataset.pdf](./DT_GAN_BMVC_SDI_dataset.pdf)
